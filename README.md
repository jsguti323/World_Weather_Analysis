# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
We collected and anaylzed data across cities worldwide so PlanMyTrip could recommend hotels to clients based on weather preferences. We did so by creating a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process entailed collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
